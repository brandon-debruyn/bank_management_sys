Grade Achieved: 87%

# Problem Description:

You are asked to develop an application to manage bank services. An account is a general
account class that contains balance, deposit, transfer and withdrawal methods. Your bank should allow the creation of two bank
accounts types. The two types of accounts should include:

 - Savings accounts: these only allow one withdrawal or one transfer per month, and might also be opened by teenagers from 14 years old.
 - Checking accounts: these are regular accounts that can be opened by customers who are 18 years or older. They can also have a negative balance to a specified credit limit. All the bank **information should be stored in three external files: customers.txt, accounts.txt, accountsTransactions.txt.** It is up to you to define the structure of each file, but each customer, account or transaction should have an unique ID. Use Python classes to implement the bank system. Some of the functionality your system should provide includes:
 - At least the following classes: Account, Saving Account, Checking Account, Customer.
 - Saving Account and Checking Account should be a subclass of Account.
 - Each class should have an __init__ and __str__ methods. For each __str__ method, think what information each class should provide when you print their instances.
 - Persistent memory: when you start your system it should read the files customers.txt, accounts.txt, and accountsTransactions.txt in the same folder as the python code and create all the necessary instances.
 - Provide a command line interface for the user to:
   - Customer creating a new account.
   - Customer viewing the transactions performed in one of his accounts and the respective balance.
   - Customer performing the operations allowed by its account type.
   - Customer deletes his/her account.
   - Make sure to update the external files after any information is modified.
